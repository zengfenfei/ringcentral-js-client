One common\n\t   * mistake is to accidentally invoke the function yourself instead of letting\n\t   * the `throw` assertion invoke the function for you. For example, when\n\t   * testing if a function named `fn` throws, provide `fn` instead of `fn()` as\n\t   * the target for the assertion.\n\t   *\n\t   *     expect(fn).to.throw();     // Good! Tests `fn` as desired\n\t   *     expect(fn()).to.throw();   // Bad! Tests result of `fn()`, not `fn`\n\t   *\n\t   * If you need to assert that your function `fn` throws when passed certain\n\t   * arguments, then wrap a call to `fn` inside of another function.\n\t   *\n\t   *     expect(function () { fn(42); }).to.throw();  // Function expression\n\t   *     expect(() => fn(42)).to.throw();             // ES6 arrow function\n\t   *\n\t   * Another common mistake is to provide an object method (or any stand-alone\n\t   * function that relies on `this`) as the target of the assertion. Doing so is\n\t   * problematic because the `this` context will be lost when the function is\n\t   * invoked by `.throw`; there's no way for it to know what `this` is supposed\n\t   * to be. There are two ways around this problem. One solution is to wrap the\n\t   * method or function call inside of another function. Another solution is to\n\t   * use `bind`.\n\t   *\n\t   *     expect(function () { cat.meow(); }).to.throw();  // Function expression\n\t   *     expect(() => cat.meow()).to.throw();             // ES6 arrow function\n\t   *     expect(cat.meow.bind(cat)).to.throw();           // Bind\n\t   *\n\t   * Finally, it's worth mentioning that it's a best practice in JavaScript to\n\t   * only throw `Error` and derivatives of `Error` such as `ReferenceError`,\n\t   * `TypeError`, and user-defined objects that extend `Error`. No other type of\n\t   * value will generate a stack trace when initialized. With that said, the\n\t   * `throw` assertion does technically support any type of value being thrown,\n\t   * not just `Error` and its derivatives.\n\t   *\n\t   * The aliases `.throws` and `.Throw` can be used interchangeably with\n\t   * `.throw`.\n\t   *\n\t   * @name throw\n\t   * @alias throws\n\t   * @alias Throw\n\t   * @param {Error|ErrorConstructor} errorLike\n\t   * @param {String|RegExp} errMsgMatcher error message\n\t   * @param {String} msg _optional_\n\t   * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error#Error_types\n\t   * @returns error for chaining (null if no error)\n\t   * @namespace BDD\n\t   * @api public\n\t   */\n\t\n\t  function assertThrows (errorLike, errMsgMatcher, msg) {\n\t    if (msg) flag(this, 'message', msg);\n\t    var obj = flag(this, 'object')\n\t      , ssfi = flag(this, 'ssfi')\n\t      , flagMsg = flag(this, 'message')\n\t      , negate = flag(this, 'negate') || false;\n\t    new Assertion(obj, flagMsg, ssfi, true).is.a('function');\n\t\n\t    if (errorLike instanceof RegExp || typeof errorLike === 'string') {\n\t      errMsgMatcher = errorLike;\n\t      errorLike = null;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    var caughtErr;\n\t    try {\n\t      obj();\n\t    } catch (err) {\n\t      caughtErr = err;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    // If we have the negate flag enabled and at least one valid argument it means we do expect an error\n\t    // but we want it to match a given set of criteria\n\t    var everyArgIsUndefined = errorLike === undefined && errMsgMatcher === undefined;\n\t\n\t    // If we've got the negate flag enabled and both args, we should only fail if both aren't compatible\n\t    // See Issue #551 and PR #683@GitHub\n\t    var everyArgIsDefined = Boolean(errorLike && errMsgMatcher);\n\t    var errorLikeFail = false;\n\t    var errMsgMatcherFail = false;\n\t\n\t    // Checking if error was thrown\n\t    if (everyArgIsUndefined || !everyArgIsUndefined && !negate) {\n\t      // We need this to display results correctly according to their types\n\t      var errorLikeString = 'an error';\n\t      if (errorLike instanceof Error) {\n\t        errorLikeString = '#{exp}';\n\t      } else if (errorLike) {\n\t        errorLikeString = _.checkError.getConstructorName(errorLike);\n\t      }\n\t\n\t      this.assert(\n\t          caughtErr\n\t        , 'expected #{this} to throw ' + errorLikeString\n\t        , 'expected #{this} to not throw an error but #{act} was thrown'\n\t        , errorLike && errorLike.toString()\n\t        , (caughtErr instanceof Error ?\n\t            caughtErr.toString() : (typeof caughtErr === 'string' ? caughtErr : caughtErr &&\n\t                                    _.checkError.getConstructorName(caughtErr)))\n\t      );\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    if (errorLike && caughtErr) {\n\t      // We should compare instances only if `errorLike` is an instance of `Error`\n\t      if (errorLike instanceof Error) {\n\t        var isCompatibleInstance = _.checkError.compatibleInstance(caughtErr, errorLike);\n\t\n\t        if (isCompatibleInstance === negate) {\n\t          // These checks were created to ensure we won't fail too soon when we've got both args and a negate\n\t          // See Issue #551 and PR #683@GitHub\n\t          if (everyArgIsDefined && negate) {\n\t            errorLikeFail = true;\n\t          } else {\n\t            this.assert(\n\t                negate\n\t              , 'expected #{this} to throw #{exp} but #{act} was thrown'\n\t              , 'expected #{this} to not throw #{exp}' + (caughtErr && !negate ?

The\n\t  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n\t  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n\t  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t\n\t  Terminology\n\t  -----------\n\t\n\t  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n\t  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n\t  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n\t  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n\t  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n\t  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\t\n\t  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\t\n\t  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n\t  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n\t  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\t\n\t  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n\t  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n\t  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n\t  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n\t  itself fulfill.\n\t\n\t\n\t  Basic Usage:\n\t  ------------\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n\t    // on success\n\t    resolve(value);\n\t\n\t    // on failure\n\t    reject(reason);\n\t  });\n\t\n\t  promise.then(function(value) {\n\t    // on fulfillment\n\t  }, function(reason) {\n\t    // on rejection\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  Advanced Usage:\n\t  ---------------\n\t\n\t  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n\t  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  function getJSON(url) {\n\t    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\t\n\t      xhr.open('GET', url);\n\t      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n\t      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n\t      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n\t      xhr.send();\n\t\n\t      function handler() {\n\t        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n\t          if (this.status === 200) {\n\t            resolve(this.response);\n\t          } else {\n\t            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n\t          }\n\t        }\n\t      };\n\t    });\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n\t    // on fulfillment\n\t  }, function(reason) {\n\t    // on rejection\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  Promise.all([\n\t    getJSON('/posts'),\n\t    getJSON('/comments')\n\t  ]).then(function(values){\n\t    values[0] // => postsJSON\n\t    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\t\n\t    return values;\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  @class Promise\n\t  @param {Function} resolver\n\t  Useful for tooling.\n\t  @constructor\n\t*/\n\t\n\tvar Promise$1 = function () {\n\t  function Promise(resolver) {\n\t    this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n\t    this._result = this._state = undefined;\n\t    this._subscribers = [];\n\t\n\t    if (noop !== resolver) {\n\t      typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n\t      this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n\t    }\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t  The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n\t  which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n\t  reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t   ```js\n\t  findUser().then(function(user){\n\t    // user is available\n\t  }, function(reason){\n\t    // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t   Chaining\n\t  --------\n\t   The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n\t  promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n\t  or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n\t   ```js\n\t  findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t    return user.name;\n\t  }, function (reason) {\n\t    return 'default name';\n\t  }).then(function (userName) {\n\t    // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n\t    // will be `'default name'`\n\t  });\n\t   findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t    throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n\t  }, function (reason) {\n\t    throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n\t  }).then(function (value) {\n\t    // never reached\n\t  }, function (reason) {\n\t    // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n\t    // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t  If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n\t   ```js\n\t  findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t    throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n\t  }).then(function (value) {\n\t    // never reached\n\t  }).then(function (value) {\n\t    // never reached\n\t  }, function (reason) {\n\t    // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t   Assimilation\n\t  ------------\n\t   Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n\t  retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n\t  fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n\t  until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n\t   ```js\n\t  findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n\t  }).then(function (comments) {\n\t    // The user's comments are now available\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t   If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n\t   ```js\n\t  findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n\t  }).then(function (comments) {\n\t    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n\t  }, function (reason) {\n\t    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t   Simple Example\n\t  --------------\n\t   Synchronous Example\n\t   ```javascript\n\t  let result;\n\t   try {\n\t    result = findResult();\n\t    // success\n\t  } catch(reason) {\n\t    // failure\n\t  }\n\t  ```\n\t   Errback Example\n\t   ```js\n\t  findResult(function(result, err){\n\t    if (err) {\n\t      // failure\n\t    } else {\n\t      // success\n\t    }\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t   Promise Example;\n\t   ```javascript\n\t  findResult().then(function(result){\n\t    // success\n\t  }, function(reason){\n\t    // failure\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t   Advanced Example\n\t  --------------\n\t   Synchronous Example\n\t   ```javascript\n\t  let author, books;\n\t   try {\n\t    author = findAuthor();\n\t    books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n\t    // success\n\t  } catch(reason) {\n\t    // failure\n\t  }\n\t  ```\n\t   Errback Example\n\t   ```js\n\t   function foundBooks(books) {\n\t   }\n\t   function failure(reason) {\n\t   }\n\t   findAuthor(function(author, err){\n\t    if (err) {\n\t      failure(err);\n\t      // failure\n\t    } else {\n\t      try {\n\t        findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n\t          if (err) {\n\t            failure(err);\n\t          } else {\n\t            try {\n\t              foundBooks(books);\n\t            } catch(reason) {\n\t              failure(reason);\n\t            }\n\t          }\n\t        });\n\t      } catch(error) {\n\t        failure(err);\n\t      }\n\t      // success\n\t    }\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t   Promise Example;\n\t   ```javascript\n\t  findAuthor().\n\t    then(findBooksByAuthor).\n\t    then(function(books){\n\t      // found books\n\t  }).catch(function(reason){\n\t    // something went wrong\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t   @method then\n\t  @param {Function} onFulfilled\n\t  @param {Function} onRejected\n\t  Useful for tooling.\n\t  @return {Promise}\n\t  */\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t  `catch` is simply sugar for `then(undefined, onRejection)` which makes it the same\n\t  as the catch block of a try/catch statement.\n\t  ```js\n\t  function findAuthor(){\n\t  throw new Error('couldn't find that author');\n\t  }\n\t  // synchronous\n\t  try {\n\t  findAuthor();\n\t  } catch(reason) {\n\t  // something went wrong\n\t  }\n\t  // async with promises\n\t  findAuthor().catch(function(reason){\n\t  // something went wrong\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t  @method catch\n\t  @param {Function} onRejection\n\t  Useful for tooling.\n\t  @return {Promise}\n\t  */\n\t\n\t\n\t  Promise.prototype.catch = function _catch(onRejection) {\n\t    return this.then(null, onRejection);\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t    `finally` will be invoked regardless of the promise's fate just as native\n\t    try/catch/finally behaves\n\t  \n\t    Synchronous example:\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findAuthor() {\n\t      if (Math.random() > 0.5) {\n\t        throw new Error();\n\t      }\n\t      return new Author();\n\t    }\n\t  \n\t    try {\n\t      return findAuthor();

One common\n   * mistake is to accidentally invoke the function yourself instead of letting\n   * the `throw` assertion invoke the function for you.

Tests `fn` as desired\n   *     expect(fn()).to.throw();   // Bad! Tests result of `fn()`, not `fn`\n   *\n   * If you need to assert that your function `fn` throws when passed certain\n   * arguments, then wrap a call to `fn` inside of another function.\n   *\n   *     expect(function () { fn(42); }).to.throw();  // Function expression\n   *     expect(() => fn(42)).to.throw();             // ES6 arrow function\n   *\n   * Another common mistake is to provide an object method (or any stand-alone\n   * function that relies on `this`) as the target of the assertion. Doing so is\n   * problematic because the `this` context will be lost when the function is\n   * invoked by `.throw`; there's no way for it to know what `this` is supposed\n   * to be. There are two ways around this problem. One solution is to wrap the\n   * method or function call inside of another function. Another solution is to\n   * use `bind`.\n   *\n   *     expect(function () { cat.meow(); }).to.throw();  // Function expression\n   *     expect(() => cat.meow()).to.throw();             // ES6 arrow function\n   *     expect(cat.meow.bind(cat)).to.throw();           // Bind\n   *\n   * Finally, it's worth mentioning that it's a best practice in JavaScript to\n   * only throw `Error` and derivatives of `Error` such as `ReferenceError`,\n   * `TypeError`, and user-defined objects that extend `Error`.

The\n  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n  Terminology\n  -----------\n\n  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n  itself fulfill.\n\n\n  Basic Usage:\n  ------------\n\n  ```js\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // on success\n    resolve(value);\n\n    // on failure\n    reject(reason);\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Advanced Usage:\n  ---------------\n\n  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n  ```js\n  function getJSON(url) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n      xhr.open('GET', url);\n      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n      xhr.send();\n\n      function handler() {\n        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n          if (this.status === 200) {\n            resolve(this.response);\n          } else {\n            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n          }\n        }\n      };\n    });\n  }\n\n  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n  ```js\n  Promise.all([\n    getJSON('/posts'),\n    getJSON('/comments')\n  ]).then(function(values){\n    values[0] // => postsJSON\n    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n    return values;\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @class Promise\n  @param {Function} resolver\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @constructor\n*/\n\nvar Promise = function () {\n  function Promise(resolver) {\n    this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n    this._result = this._state = undefined;\n    this._subscribers = [];\n\n    if (noop !== resolver) {\n      typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n      this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n  The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n  which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n  reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function(user){\n    // user is available\n  }, function(reason){\n    // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n  });\n  ```\n   Chaining\n  --------\n   The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n  promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n  or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return user.name;\n  }, function (reason) {\n    return 'default name';\n  }).then(function (userName) {\n    // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n    // will be `'default name'`\n  });\n   findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n  }, function (reason) {\n    throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n    // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n  });\n  ```\n  If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n  });\n  ```\n   Assimilation\n  ------------\n   Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n  retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n  fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n  until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // The user's comments are now available\n  });\n  ```\n   If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n  });\n  ```\n   Simple Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let result;\n   try {\n    result = findResult();\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n   Errback Example\n   ```js\n  findResult(function(result, err){\n    if (err) {\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n   Promise Example;\n   ```javascript\n  findResult().then(function(result){\n    // success\n  }, function(reason){\n    // failure\n  });\n  ```\n   Advanced Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let author, books;\n   try {\n    author = findAuthor();\n    books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n   Errback Example\n   ```js\n   function foundBooks(books) {\n   }\n   function failure(reason) {\n   }\n   findAuthor(function(author, err){\n    if (err) {\n      failure(err);\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      try {\n        findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n          if (err) {\n            failure(err);\n          } else {\n            try {\n              foundBooks(books);\n            } catch(reason) {\n              failure(reason);\n            }\n          }\n        });\n      } catch(error) {\n        failure(err);\n      }\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n   Promise Example;\n   ```javascript\n  findAuthor().\n    then(findBooksByAuthor).\n    then(function(books){\n      // found books\n  }).catch(function(reason){\n    // something went wrong\n  });\n  ```\n   @method then\n  @param {Function} onFulfilled\n  @param {Function} onRejected\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise}\n  */\n\n  /**\n  `catch` is simply sugar for `then(undefined, onRejection)` which makes it the same\n  as the catch block of a try/catch statement.\n  ```js\n  function findAuthor(){\n  throw new Error('couldn't find that author');\n  }\n  // synchronous\n  try {\n  findAuthor();\n  } catch(reason) {\n  // something went wrong\n  }\n  // async with promises\n  findAuthor().catch(function(reason){\n  // something went wrong\n  });\n  ```\n  @method catch\n  @param {Function} onRejection\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise}\n  */\n\n\n  Promise.prototype.catch = function _catch(onRejection) {\n    return this.then(null, onRejection);\n  };\n\n  /**\n    `finally` will be invoked regardless of the promise's fate just as native\n    try/catch/finally behaves\n  \n    Synchronous example:\n  \n    ```js\n    findAuthor() {\n      if (Math.random() > 0.5) {\n        throw new Error();\n      }\n      return new Author();\n    }\n  \n    try {\n      return findAuthor();
